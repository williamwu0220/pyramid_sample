This project provides a form with two fields to let you input values, name and age respectively.
If the input values are good, they will be inserted into the table 'info', and then redirect to the route /list.
You may check the result on the list page after submit the form. Note that before this project works, 
you have to create a sqlite3 database, db.db for example, and create a table by following command: 
create table info (name text, age int);
